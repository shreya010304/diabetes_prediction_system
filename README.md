Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts if a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic data using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and building models for binary classification.

Project Files

Diabetes_prediction_BinaryClassification.ipynb → An end-to-end machine learning workflow that includes data cleaning, visualization, and classification.
Diabetes_prediction_model.ipynb → Focuses on training and testing machine learning models for prediction.

Tech Stack

Python

Dataset

The dataset contains medical attributes such as: 
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin Level  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

(Each record is labeled as 0 for Non-Diabetic or 1 for Diabetic)
